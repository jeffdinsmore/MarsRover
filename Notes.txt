1. Get functional API KEY from NASA Site
2. figure out what we want to do! 
3. Pictures from the rover? 
4. How to search? Should it be random? Pictures from a week ago? 
Created the google of Mars Rover Pictures. That would be cool
set Maximum Sol Date
show information about the Pictures (little caption)
Make it look like google
display 3 pictures in a poloroid looking format
show earth date, name of rover, what camera
add more apis to get weather from picture for that date
seperate promise logic
